# Bone Sword

Adds the bone sword from the mod "Fish's Undead Rising" to BTA.

It works just like the original mod(deals extra damage on entities depending on their health), but with some small differences like durability.

You'll require to add it as a jarmod since it modifies gui/items.png and lang/en_US.lang and issue [#174](https://github.com/SkyDeckAGoGo/bta-issues/issues/174) hasn't been implemented yet.
